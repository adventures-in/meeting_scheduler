# meeting_scheduler

*Adventures in scheduling across timezones.*

A project by the [Adventures In \[Dart, Flutter, Firebase\]] group.

Goals:

- Help people find a good meeting time across multiple timezones
- Authenticate and sync with Google calendar so both exisiting schedules & timezones are used to find a good time

Feel free to join us as we experiment with ways to solve this problem, using:

- FlutterFire packages: [firebase_messaging], [firebase_auth], [cloud_firestore]
- [Firebase Cloud Functions] for the notifications App Server
- [Riverpod] for state management
- [go_router] for navigation
